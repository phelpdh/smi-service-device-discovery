Purpose
~~~~~~~

Given an IP Range and credentials, the service attemps to connect to each IP address to try and identify and retrieve basic summary information for all devices within the range. It is written primarily for finding Dell devices, but may identify a few others in the datacenter as well. It is a stateless (12 factor app) that returns a JSON summary response.

This microservice can be used by itself, or as one piece of a larger discovery and inventory effort. This service is used by RackHD as part of a Dell WSMAN discovery and inventory workflow (taskgraph). It is one of several Docker containerized micro-services used as part of the workflow.

How to Use
~~~~~~~~~~

A docker container for this service is available at:
https://hub.docker.com/r/rackhd/device-discovery/

....
docker run --name device-discovery -p 0.0.0.0:46002:46002 -d rackhd/device-discovery:latest
....

The service can also start up to bootstrap its configuration from consul. More information about registration with and using advanced configuration settings provided by a Consul K/V store can be found in the online help.

CURL example with one network range payload
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The micro-service REST endpoints can be invoked via CURL or via another application.

Example:

....
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"credential":{"user": "root","password": "calvin"},"discoverIpRangeDeviceRequests":[{"deviceType": null,"deviceStartIp": "100.68.123.1","deviceEndIp": "100.68.123.254","credential": null}]}' http://<ip>:46002/api/1.0/discover/range
....

Example payloads
++++++++++++++++

The payload allows for global and local (per range) credentials and device types. Global values are always overwritten by local values.

Example Payload 1.

Use global credentials (override all credentials in application yml for all devices) 
....
/api/1.0/discover/range

{
   "credential":{
      "userName":"root",
      "password":"calvin"
   },
   "discoverIpRangeDeviceRequests":[
      {
         "deviceStartIp":"100.68.124.6",
         "deviceEndIp":"100.68.124.57",
      }
   ]
}

/api/1.0/discover/ips:

{
 "credential": {
    "password": "calvin1",
    "userName": "root1"
  },
 "ips": [
    "100.68.124.37","100.68.124.43"
  ]
}
....

Example Payload 2.

Use Credential specific to device type (Override credential from application YML specific to devices). If global credentials are supplied (as in example 1 above), the specific device credentials will be used instead for that device type. 

....
/api/1.0/discover/range

{
   "discoverIpRangeDeviceRequests":[
      {
         "deviceType":["SERVER"],
         "deviceStartIp":"100.68.124.0",
         "deviceEndIp":"100.68.124.255",
         "credential":{
			"userName":"abc0",
			"password":"xyz0"
		 }
      },
      {
         "deviceType":["CHASSIS"],
         "deviceStartIp":"100.68.12.0",
         "deviceEndIp":"100.68.12.255",
         "credential":{
			"userName":"abc1",
			"password":"xyz1"
		 }
      },
      {
         "deviceType":["IOM"],
         "deviceStartIp":"100.68.123.0",
         "deviceEndIp":"100.68.123.255",
         "credential":{
			"userName":"abc2",
			"password":"xyz2"
		 }
      },
      {
         "deviceType":["SWITCH"],
         "deviceStartIp":"100.68.13.0",
         "deviceEndIp":"100.68.13.255",
         "credential":{
			"userName":"abc3",
			"password":"xyz3"
		 }
      },
      {
         "deviceType":["VM"],
         "deviceStartIp":"100.68.126.0",
         "deviceEndIp":"100.68.126.255",
         "credential":{
			"userName":"abc4",
			"password":"xyz4"
		 }
      },
      {
         "deviceType":["STORAGE"],
         "deviceStartIp":"100.68.14.0",
         "deviceEndIp":"100.68.14.255",
         "credential":{
			"userName":"abc5",
			"password":"xyz5"
		 }
      }
   ]
}

Example Payload 3.

Use default device credentials (configured in application.yml). This option is for when you want to pull credentials from a supplied configuration at service startup, to prevent the consuming application from needing to be aware of them.

....

/api/1.0/discover/range

{
   "discoverIpRangeDeviceRequests":
   [
      {
         "deviceType":["SERVER"],
         "deviceStartIp":"100.68.124.6",
         "deviceEndIp":"100.68.124.57",
      },
      {
         "deviceType":["CHASSIS"],
         "deviceStartIp":"100.68.123.6",
         "deviceEndIp":"100.68.123.57",
      }
   ]
}

/api/1.0/discover/ips:

{
 "ips": [
    "100.68.124.37","100.68.124.43"
  ]
}

OR 

{
 "deviceType":["SERVER","CHASSIS"],
 "ips": [
    "100.68.124.37","100.68.124.43"
  ]
}
....

Example Payload 4.

The example payload below will attempt to discover servers and chassis in the ip range 100.68.124.11 - 57, using the global credentials "root" and "calvin". It will also attempt to discover switches in the ip range of 100.68.124.6 - 10, using the range specific credentials "abc0" and "xyz0"

....

/api/1.0/discover/range
{
   "credential":{
      "userName": "root",
      "password": "calvin"
   },
   "deviceType": ["SERVER", "CHASSIS"],
   "discoverIpRangeDeviceRequests":[
        {
            "deviceStartIp": "100.68.124.6",
            "deviceEndIp": "100.68.124.10",
            "credential":{
                "userName": "abc0",
                "password": "xyz0"
            },
            "deviceType": ["SWITCH"],
        },
        {
            "deviceStartIp": "100.68.124.11",
            "deviceEndIp": "100.68.124.57"
        }
